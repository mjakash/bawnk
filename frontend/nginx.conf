# You might have http block settings here (usually in the main nginx.conf, not default.conf)

server { # <-- The server block defines a virtual host

    server_name localhost; # Domain name (doesn't matter much inside Docker)

    root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Root directory for files
    index index.html index.htm; # Default files to serve

# You could potentially have more server blocks here
